### 🔐 Security-Aware Development
This project uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore with strict security rules to:
- Restrict access on a per-user basis
- Enforce immutable consent logs (e.g. Terms and Conditions acceptance)
- Deny all unauthorized operations by default

All user data is protected through Firebase’s backend-enforced rule system, ensuring privacy and control over personal content.
